            <p>
An approach to solar driven hydrogen generation will be to couple an electrolyzer to a photovoltaic device for which it is imperative to design highly active, stable and inexpensive oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts with porous three-dimensional electrode architecture. Metallic interlayers within such composite electrode assemblies not only provide effective electron percolation pathways but also modulate the electronic structure of the active electrocatalysts.</p>
